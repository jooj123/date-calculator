## Problem

You have joined a science project as the latest team
member. Scientists on the project are running a series
of experiments and need to calculate the number of
full days elapsed in between the experimentâ€™s start and
end dates,  i.e. the first and the last day are considered
partial days and never counted. Following this logic,
an experiment that has run from 07/11/1972 and
08/11/1972 should return 0, because there are no
fully elapsed days contained in between those dates,
and 01/01/2000 to 03/01/2000 should return 1. The solution
needs to cater for all valid dates between 01/01/1901
and 31/12/2999.

## Test Cases

These should work as a minimum:

* 02/06/1983 - 22/06/1983: 19 days
* 04/07/1984 - 25/12/1984: 173 days
* 03/01/1989 - 03/08/1983: 1979 days

## Note

Language features/classes, (i.e. native date or calendar classes),
framework classes or helper libraries are NOT used to solve the
problem.

## Requirements
- Install [Node.js >= 4.2](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
- Mac or Linux (I have not tested on windows - might work?)

## Run
Note: this will do a babel transcompile before the script is run

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`

The script will ask for the first and second date and then echo the result.

## Run Tests

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test`
